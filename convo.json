It is a staple in many South Asian cuisines and is commonly served with curries, vegetables, and other Indian dishes. Here's a simple recipe for making soft and delicious rotis:\n\nIngredients:\n\n- 2 cups whole wheat flour (atta)\n- Approximately 3/4 to 1 cup warm water\n- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil or ghee (clarified butter) for kneading\n- Extra flour for dusting while rolling\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Prepare the Dough:\n   - In a mixing bowl, add the whole wheat flour (atta).\n   - Slowly add warm water little by little and start kneading the dough with your hands. The amount of water may vary, so add it gradually until you achieve a soft and smooth dough. It should not be too sticky or too dry.\n   - Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil or ghee to the dough and knead it again for a couple of minutes. This step makes the dough smoother and easier to work with.\n   - Cover the dough with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 15-20 minutes. Resting the dough makes it easier to roll and results in softer rotis.\n\n2. Divide and Shape the Dough:\n   - After resting, divide the dough into equal-sized small balls. The size depends on how big you want your rotis to be; typically, you can make around 8-10 balls from this quantity of dough.\n   - Take one dough ball, flatten it slightly with your hands, and dip it in some dry flour to prevent sticking while rolling.\n\n3. Roll the Rotis:\n   - On a clean and dry surface or rolling board, start rolling the dough ball with a rolling pin. Use some dry flour for dusting whenever needed to prevent sticking.\n   - Roll the dough ball into a thin, circular shape. Try to make it as even as possible for uniform cooking.\n\n4. Cook the Rotis:\n   - Heat a tawa or a flat skillet on medium-high heat. Once hot, place the rolled roti on the tawa.\n   - Cook for about 30 seconds to 1 minute until you see bubbles forming on the surface. Then, flip the roti to the other side.\n\n5. Finish Cooking:\n   - Cook the other side for another 30 seconds to 1 minute until light brown spots appear on the surface of the roti.\n   - If everything goes well, the roti will puff up during the cooking process. You can gently press the roti with a clean kitchen towel or a spatula to encourage puffing.\n   - Remove the cooked roti from the tawa and place it in a covered container or a clean kitchen towel to keep it soft and warm.\n   - Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls.\n\nServe the hot and freshly made rotis with your favorite curries, vegetables, or any other side dish of your choice.
