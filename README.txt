
Recipe Bot is a Python-based chatbot that can assist you in finding recipes.
It allows you to interact with it through both text and speech recognition.
You can ask it questions about recipes, and it will provide you with relevant information based on a pre-defined set of recipes.

Features:

Voice Recognition: The bot can understand and respond to voice commands, making it easy to use even without typing.
Text-Based Interaction: You can also type your questions or commands for the bot to respond to.
Recipe Search: The bot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand your queries and provide you with relevant recipes.
User-Friendly Interface: The graphical user interface (GUI) is designed for easy interaction with the bot.
